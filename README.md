# COVID-19_Analysis


The purpose of this project was to analyse the realtime data of COVID-19 infected population fetched from the website of European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, observe the change in cases and predict the expected future outcomes.
For this purpose a self-defined library "corona_data.py" was used which fetches data from the website and sorts it out.
Then to observe the change, the change in data for over 2 weeks was considered as the Covid patient usually takes this much time to recover.
At the end the data was plotted to observe the change.
